## How to Contribute

Contributing to the CatLINK v2 Custom Integration for Home Assistant is a great way to help improve the project, add new features, fix bugs, or enhance documentation. We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. Here's how you can get started:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project under your own GitHub account. You can make changes in this fork without affecting the original project.

- Go to the GitHub page for the CatLINK v2 Custom Integration.
- Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine to begin working on it.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/catlink.git
cd catlink
```

### 3. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch. This keeps your changes organized and allows you to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously.

```shell
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Now you can start coding! Make your desired changes to the codebase, whether it's adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or improving the documentation.

- Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions.
- If you are adding a new feature, consider writing tests to ensure it works as expected.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once your changes are ready, commit them to your branch.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Description of the changes"
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

```shell
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Finally, navigate to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR). This will submit your changes for review and potential inclusion in the main project.

- Go to the "Pull Requests" section of the original repository.
- Click "New Pull Request" and select your branch.
- Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information.

### 8. Participate in the Review Process

Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Be prepared to make additional changes based on their feedback. The review process is collaborative, and maintainers may suggest improvements to your code or ask questions about your implementation.
